# Feed Forward

Feedforward neural networks represent a foundational architecture in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Characterized by their simple, yet powerful structure, feedforward networks consist of interconnected layers of neurons, where information flows strictly in one direction â€“ from input to output. This architecture enables the network to map input data to output predictions, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

Within this repository, you'll find a comprehensive array of kernels tailored for feedforward neural networks, a cornerstone of modern machine learning.

To understand fundamentals of Feedforward Neural Netowrks, refer to the [stanford's webpage](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/neural-networks/Architecture/feedforward.html), and for a working example of back propagation, you can [watch this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khUVIZ3MON8).
