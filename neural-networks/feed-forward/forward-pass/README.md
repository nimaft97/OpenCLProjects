# Forward Pass

The forward pass of the feedforward model implemented in this repository, which specializes in regression tasks, follows a specific architecture. In this setup, the output layer comprises a single node. During the forward pass, the input data propagates through the network, undergoing transformations dictated by the weights and activation functions of each layer. At the output layer, the final prediction is computed, representing the regression result. This process encapsulates the essence of regression within the feedforward model, offering a streamlined approach to predicting continuous values.

### Assumptions

- There is only one block of threads (work group) executing the kernel because there is no point in having work-items distributed between multiple work-groups for this problem.
- Maximum number of nodes per each layer is 30 (modifiable)

## Getting Started

To use the forward pass implementation in your project, follow the steps outlined in the README. You'll find instructions on building, configuring, and integrating the code into your OpenCL-enabled application.

### Installing OpenCL
It is assumed that OpenCL is already installed. The commands used in the OpenCL installation process are listed below:

- Follow the steps in [OpenCL Windows Installation Manual](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Guide/blob/main/chapters/getting_started_windows.md)
- (Windows users) Open a Windows Power Shell with Administrative provileges

       1. `if (-not (Test-Path ~\Documents\PowerShell)) { New-Item -Type Directory ~\Documents\PowerShell }`
       2. `Import-Module "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll" >> $PROFILE`
       3. `function devshell { Enter-VsDevShell -InstallPath "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\" -SkipAutomaticLocation -DevCmdArguments "-arch=x64 -no_logo" }  ` 
       4. `devshell -VsInstallPath 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\Tools' -DevCmdArguments '-arch=x64 -no_logo'`

### Compilitation

Go to the main dircteroy of the project and do the following:

#### Command-line

- `cl.exe /nologo /TC /W4 /DCL_TARGET_OPENCL_VERSION=100 /IC:\Users\nimaf\OneDrive\Desktop\IE\projects\opencl-proj\OpenCL-SDK\install\include\ Main.c /Fe:HelloOpenCL /link /LIBPATH:C:\Users\nimaf\OneDrive\Desktop\IE\projects\opencl-proj\OpenCL-SDK\install\lib OpenCL.lib`
       
#### CMake

- Go to where the CMake exists
- `cmake -A x64 -S . -B .\build -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\Users\nimaf\OneDrive\Desktop\IE\projects\opencl-proj\OpenCL-SDK\install\` 


### Building

- `cmake --build .\build --config <Release/Debug>`
- Find the executable under builds in the folder created for the requested config (Release/Debug)
